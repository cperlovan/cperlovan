### Hi there 👋!
<hr />
<h1>👉<strong>About me</strong></h1>


Developing web applications has been a passion for me. I enjoy creating and facing new challenges, when I make solutions in my work environment. I have had the opportunity to use several programming languages, but today, after many hours of study, I find Javascript, React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and other technologies that motivate me to create and continue with this wonderful world of programming. programming
